# Tennis Court Detection

Leveraging the OpenCV library to detect tennis courts from overhead satellite images based on distinct geometric features.

There are two separate methodologies being worked on:

1) Geometric Analysis: Identify tennis courts by processing input images down to black and white lines from which contours can be found and filtered.

2) Haar Cascade Classification (Machine Learning): Train a cascade classifer with many positive and negative images in order to effectively detect tennis courts from input aerial images.
