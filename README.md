# Tennis Court Detection

(WORK-IN-PROGRESS)

Leveraging the OpenCV library to detect tennis courts from overhead satellite images based on distinct geometric features.

There are two separate methodologies being worked on:

<b>1) Geometric Analysis:</b> Identify tennis courts by processing input images down to black and white lines from which contours can be found and filtered.

<b>2) Cascading Classification (Machine Learning):</b> Train a cascade classifer with many positive and negative images in order to effectively detect tennis courts from input aerial images.
